# Recipe Digitizer

This is a relatively simple web application intended to aid in digitizing recipes. 

**Note:** While I'm keeping everything relatively universal, this is intended to be used specifically by my parents, so I make no gurantees about widerspread usage.

## Goals

Make a web application and database for digitizing, storing, and accessing written recipes.

## Installation

Installation's relatively straightforward, just run: 

```
yarn install
```

## Usage

This is still in development, so it's not ready for actual deployment.
As such, just run:
```
yarn start
```

## Problems

I don't intend for this to be used by anyone else. That said, if you find any issues, feel free to reach out to me and I'll try and take a look at this. I'm by no means a web expert so any chances to learn more is great.
